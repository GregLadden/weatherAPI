# API practice using Javasript 1/5
I want to become more familiar with Javascript and API calls so I have set a goal to build 5 apps. I will not use frameworks but only vanilla JS. There is no styling in this project. The goal was to build an app that would take in two inputs that would customize the API call and then display the data on the page. 

## Tech Used

* WeatherAPI
* Javascript 
* HTML5
