# Javascript Practice | App 1/5
I want to become more familiar with Javascript and API calls. I set a goal to build 5 apps that will be front end focused, vanilla JS only (no frameworks), and I must use 5 different APIs. 

## WeatherAPI App
My goal for this app was to become familiar with fetch/catch and to give the user freedom to search based on a zip code and country. There is no styling as I wanted to focus on JS.
## Tech Used

* WeatherAPI
* Javascript 
* HTML5
